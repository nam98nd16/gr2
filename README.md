# What is this project?
This is a skill assessment system allowing users to assess their skills by answering multiple-choice questions in numerous fields of knowledge. Users should also be able to propose their own questions which are then reviewed by experts in the corresponding knowledge area. Users are also able to do various other things such as reviewing their own performance, making friends with other people, viewing friendsâ€™ performance, viewing leaderboards containing the best players in each knowledge area, and updating profiles, including avatars. Admins can perform privileged tasks such as managing subjects and users.
